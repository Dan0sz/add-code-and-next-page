This plugin adds buttons to the visual editor to add <code /> and <!--nextpage--> to your posts easily!

== Description ==

As a developer/blogger I catch myself searching for buttons to insert <code>-tags in my text. The code editor in WordPress does offer this button, but the TinyMCE visual editor doesn't! So I decided to add this button myself, along with a button to insert the <!--nextpage--> tag easily -- for those of us who like to write long articles!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/add-code-and-next-page` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

No further configuration required.
