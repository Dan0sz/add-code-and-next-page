This plugin adds buttons to the visual editor to add `<code />` and `<!--nextpage-->` to your posts easily!

== Description ==

As a developer/blogger I catch myself searching for buttons to insert `<code>`-tags in my text. If you disable the Visual Editor, the code editor does offer a shortcut to insert the `<code>` tags.

I created this plugin to save you and me some time by not having to switch back and forth between the code- and Visual editor anymore. And if you're like and you like to write long posts, you'll be happy to know that this plugin also adds a shortcut for the `<!--nextpage-->` tag to WordPress' Visual Editor!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/add-code-and-next-page` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

No further configuration required.
